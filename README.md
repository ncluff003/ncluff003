<h1 align="center"> Hi there! My name is Nathan Cluff! :zap: </h1>
<p align="center">Follower of Christ | Husband | Father | Full-Stack Developer</p>
<br><br>
<h3 align="center">Now that we have the important stuff out there, here is more about me:</h3>
<br><br>

<h4 align="center">Having hobbies outside of development, and many outside of tech is important to me.  If I am asked any questions about the following, and you are showing genuine interest, we could very well be friends.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Playing and watching sports. <img src='/Images/Chiefs-logo.jpg' style='height: 25px; width: auto;' alt='Kansas City Chiefs Logo'/> Go Chiefs! <img src='/Images/byu-logo.jpg' style='height: 25px; width: auto;' alt='BYU Logo'/> Go Cougars! <img src='/Images/la-lakers-logo.jpg' style='height: 25px; width: auto;' alt='Los Angeles Lakers Logo'/> Go Lakers</li>
  <li>Food in general, whether cooking, baking, going out to eat, or even gardening / farming.  I really want to start doing that last one because food is so delicious when fresh. 🍔 🍕 🍰 🌮 🏡 🧑‍🌾</li>
  <li>Video Games -- I love many Genres, but Sports and RPG are really fun. 🎮</li>
  <li> ⛺ Going camping and spending time with family is always a fun time for me.  Combine with #2 food, and it can be to die for, especially something like tin-foil dinners and having peach cobbler from a dutch oven. 🍑 🥧 😋</li>
  <li>Could napping be a hobby?  After a long day, or even in some downtime, I definitely love me a good nap to be able to re-charge and get right back into life. 🛏️ 😜</li>
</ul>
